## The process

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge and I am really proud of the result I got. 

I know it's a simple project, but I was able to practice my HTML and CSS and still have some learnings in the process. And that's what matters in the end!

Well, my main learning was centering the elements horizontally and specially vertically.

## Next steps

I wanna improve my frontend skills by building more projects in the Frontend Mentor.

**Let's code!** ðŸš€
